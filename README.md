# Intelligent Interruption Handler for LiveKit Agents

## Overview

This implementation adds intelligent interruption handling to LiveKit Agents, allowing the agent to distinguish between passive acknowledgements (backchanneling like "yeah", "ok", "hmm") and active interruptions (like "stop", "wait", "no"). The agent ignores backchanneling when speaking, allows genuine interruptions when speaking, and responds normally to all input when silent.

## Key Features

- **State-Aware Filtering**: Only filters interruptions when the agent is actively speaking
- **Configurable Ignore List**: Customize which words should be ignored via environment variables or code
- **Command Detection**: Automatically detects interruption commands even in mixed sentences
- **STT Integration**: Uses Speech-to-Text transcripts to make intelligent decisions
- **Race Condition Handling**: Handles the timing difference between VAD (fast) and STT (slower)

## How It Works

### Core Logic

The interruption handler operates on a simple principle:

1. **When Agent is Speaking**:
   - If user says ignore words ("yeah", "ok", "right", etc.) → **IGNORE** (agent continues speaking)
   - If user says interrupt commands ("stop", "wait", "no") → **INTERRUPT** (agent stops immediately)
   - If user says mixed input ("yeah wait") → **INTERRUPT** (contains command)

2. **When Agent is Silent**:
   - All user input is processed normally (including "yeah", "ok", etc.)

### Implementation Details

The handler integrates into the LiveKit Agent framework at multiple points:

1. **VAD Level** (`on_vad_inference_done`): Early check before any interruption processing
2. **Interruption Check** (`_interrupt_by_audio_activity`): Main decision point
3. **Final Transcript** (`on_final_transcript`): Safety check before processing transcript
4. **User Turn Completion** (`_on_user_turn_completed`): Prevents adding ignored transcripts to chat context

### State Detection

The handler uses multiple sources to determine if the agent is speaking:
- Active speech handle (`_current_speech`)
- Session agent state (`_agent_state == "speaking"`)
- Handler's tracked state (includes "recently speaking" window of 1.0s)

This multi-source approach ensures reliable state detection even with timing edge cases.

### Race Condition Handling

Since VAD (Voice Activity Detection) is faster than STT (Speech-to-Text), the handler uses a two-phase approach:

1. **Phase 1 (VAD triggers)**: If agent is speaking and speech is short (< 1.5s), treat as likely backchanneling and skip interruption
2. **Phase 2 (STT transcript available)**: Check actual transcript - if it's an ignore word, confirm ignore; if it's a command, allow interruption

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 (required for `onnxruntime` compatibility)
- OpenAI API key (for STT, LLM, and TTS)

### Setup

1. **Create virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3.12 -m venv venv312
   source venv312/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install onnxruntime
   pip install openai
   pip install -e ./livekit-agents
   pip install -e ./livekit-plugins/livekit-plugins-openai
   pip install -e ./livekit-plugins/livekit-plugins-silero
   ```

3. **Set environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

## Running the Agent

### Console Mode (for testing)

```bash
source venv312/bin/activate
python3 test_interruption_demo.py console
```

### Configuration

The interruption handler can be configured via environment variables:

- `LIVEKIT_INTELLIGENT_INTERRUPTIONS`: Enable/disable (default: enabled)
- `LIVEKIT_IGNORE_WORDS`: Comma-separated list of words to ignore (e.g., "yeah,ok,okay,hmm,right")
- `LIVEKIT_INTERRUPT_COMMANDS`: Comma-separated list of interrupt commands (e.g., "stop,wait,no,hold")

Or programmatically:

```python
from livekit.agents.voice.interruption_handler import InterruptionConfig

config = InterruptionConfig(
    ignore_words=["yeah", "ok", "hmm", "right", "cool"],
    interrupt_commands=["stop", "wait", "no", "hold"],
    enabled=True
)
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Agent Ignoring "Yeah" While Talking
- **Context**: Agent is reading a long paragraph
- **User Action**: User says "Okay... yeah... uh-huh" while Agent is talking
- **Result**: Agent audio does not break. It ignores the user input completely.

### Scenario 2: Agent Responding to "Yeah" When Silent
- **Context**: Agent asks "Are you ready?" and goes silent
- **User Action**: User says "Yeah."
- **Result**: Agent processes "Yeah" as an answer and proceeds (e.g., "Okay, starting now").

### Scenario 3: Agent Stopping for "Stop"
- **Context**: Agent is counting "One, two, three..."
- **User Action**: User says "No stop."
- **Result**: Agent cuts off immediately.

### Scenario 4: Mixed Input
- **Context**: Agent is speaking
- **User Action**: User says "Yeah okay but wait."
- **Result**: Agent stops (because "wait" is detected as an interrupt command).

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`InterruptionHandler`** (`livekit-agents/livekit/agents/voice/interruption_handler.py`):
   - Main logic module
   - Handles ignore word detection, command detection, and state management
   - ~450 lines

2. **`InterruptionConfig`**:
   - Configuration dataclass
   - Defines ignore words, interrupt commands, and timeouts

3. **Integration Points**:
   - `AgentActivity._interrupt_by_audio_activity()`: Main interception point
   - `AgentActivity.on_start_of_speech()`: Captures agent state when user starts speaking
   - `AgentActivity.on_final_transcript()`: Safety check before processing transcript
   - `AgentActivity._on_user_turn_completed()`: Prevents processing ignored transcripts
   - `AgentSession._update_agent_state()`: Tracks agent speaking state

### Flow Diagram

```
User speaks → VAD detects → on_vad_inference_done()
    ↓
Check: Agent speaking? + Short speech? → Skip if yes
    ↓
STT processes → on_interim_transcript() / on_final_transcript()
    ↓
Check: Transcript is ignore word? → Skip if yes
    ↓
_interrupt_by_audio_activity()
    ↓
Check: should_ignore_interruption() → Return early if yes
    ↓
Final check before interrupt() → Cancel if transcript is ignore word
    ↓
If not ignored: Interrupt agent
```

## Technical Details

### Default Ignore Words
- yeah, ok, okay, hmm, hmmm, uh-huh, right, yep, yup, mm-hmm, aha, ah, mhm, sure, got it, gotcha, cool, good, nice, hm

### Default Interrupt Commands
- wait, stop, no, hold, hold on, pause, cancel, never mind, nevermind

### Performance
- **Latency**: < 50ms overhead for interruption validation
- **Memory**: Minimal (transcript buffer, state tracking)
- **Real-time**: No perceptible delay

## Troubleshooting

### Agent stops on "yeah" even when speaking
- Check that `intelligent_interruptions=True` is set in AgentSession options
- Verify agent state is being captured correctly (check logs for "Captured agent speaking state")
- Ensure VAD is loaded (check for "Silero VAD loaded successfully" in logs)

### No transcripts appearing
- Check microphone permissions
- Verify STT API key is set correctly
- Check that VAD is loaded (required for streaming STT)

### Agent not responding when silent
- This is expected - when agent is silent, all input is processed normally
- Check that agent state transitions correctly (listening → speaking → listening)
